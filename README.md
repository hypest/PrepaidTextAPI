# PrepaidTextAPI

  An Android app to send and parse the SMS messages the operator uses to inform the subscriber about balances and other info.

  This is the code that the [myWhatsup app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.hypest.mywhatsup) is based while being an evolution of the [myF2G Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.hypest.myf2g) (the original app created by [@hypest](https://github.com/hypest)).

## Features
 * Works for Android v2.2 up to 4.3.x
 * Low level access to the SMS messaging layer
 * Sends messages silently, receives and parses the responses equaly silently
 * Can collect any unknown SMSs sent as responses from the operator and sends an email with them to the app developer (user initiates that sending, no big brother here!)
